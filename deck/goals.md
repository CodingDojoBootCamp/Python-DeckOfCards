# GOALS
* Deck Should be agnostic of type ie: we should be able to have a standard card deck, an uno deck, hell even a Magic Deck
* suits and ranks are defined when you create a deck defaults will be a standard deck no jokers
* outlier cards - most ranks will be created for every suit but we may want some that are unique (ie: jokers) create a way so that when you create a deck you can add special cards and assign them values.
* When creating a deck you should be able to pass comparison functions to adjust how cards are compared
* When creating a deck / card you can specify how the card will be displayed to screen
